# Traffic_Accident
The Traffic Accident Dataset provides detailed information on reported vehicle crashes over a given time period and geographic area. This dataset is commonly used by transportation departments, law enforcement, and data analysts to understand accident patterns, contributing factors, and severity outcomes.

# 🚦 Traffic Accident Data Analysis

This repository contains a comprehensive data analysis project focused on understanding patterns, causes, and impacts of traffic accidents using real-world crash data. The goal is to derive actionable insights for improving road safety and developing predictive strategies.

## 📊 Dataset Overview

The dataset includes traffic accident reports with features such as:

- `crash_date`, `crash_hour`, `crash_day_of_week`
- `weather_condition`, `lighting_condition`, `roadway_surface_cond`
- `prim_contributory_cause`, `first_crash_type`, `most_severe_injury`
- `injuries_fatal`, `injuries_total`, `traffic_control_device`

> Note: Data has been anonymized and cleaned before use.

## 🔍 Objectives

- Understand when and where accidents most frequently occur.
- Identify key factors contributing to crash severity.
- Perform statistical analysis on injury patterns, time trends, and road conditions.
- Build visualizations to communicate findings..
---

## ✅ Key Analyses Performed

- 🕒 **Time-Based Trends**: Accidents by hour, weekday, and month
- 🌧️ **Weather & Road Conditions**: Effect on accident severity
- ⚠️ **Injury Analysis**: Total vs. fatal injuries across scenarios
- 📊 **Chi-square & T-tests**: Statistical testing of safety factors
- 📌 **Heatmaps & Bar Charts**: Visualizing intersections, lighting, and more

---

## 📈 Sample Insights

- Most fatal crashes occur at night in low-light areas.
- Rain and snow conditions significantly increase injury rates.
- Distracted driving and failure to yield are top crash causes.
